### **Tomato Segmentation with Detectron2**

**Objective**: Segment tomatoes in images using the Detectron2 framework.

**Method**: The notebook employs Detectron2, a popular object detection and segmentation library based on the Facebook AI Research (FAIR) project. Detectron2 leverages several advanced deep learning techniques.

**Key Components**:

1. **Network Architecture**:
   - **Backbone**: The feature extraction backbone used is typically a ResNet model (e.g., ResNet-50 or ResNet-101). ResNet architectures use residual blocks with **ReLU** activation functions.
   - **Neck**: Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) are used to build multi-scale feature maps. This helps in detecting objects at different scales.
   - **Head**: The segmentation head uses a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) with **Sigmoid** activation functions to predict pixel-wise masks.

2. **Activation Functions**:
   - **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit): Commonly used in convolutional layers of the backbone for non-linearity.
   - **Sigmoid**: Used in the final segmentation head for predicting pixel-wise probabilities of object presence.

3. **Loss Function**:
   - The notebook uses a combination of **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss** for the mask prediction and **Smooth L1 Loss** for bounding box regression.

4. **Validation**:
   - **Mean Average Precision (mAP)**: This metric is used for evaluating the performance of the segmentation model. In this case, the model achieves an mAP of 61.94%.

5. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - **Optimizer**: The model is trained using the **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** optimizer with momentum and weight decay.
   - **Learning Rate Scheduler**: A learning rate scheduler is employed to adjust the learning rate during training for better convergence.

**Type of Method**: 
- **Deep Learning**: The approach utilizes deep learning techniques for object detection and segmentation. It specifically leverages advanced architectures and loss functions tailored for high-performance image segmentation tasks.
